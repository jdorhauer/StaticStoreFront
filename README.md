# StaticStoreFront

This is a static HTML page with CSS and Bootstrap used for the styling. I hope to use this basis as a format for a project one day, but the primary focus of this project was to start to learn how to style and design web pages.

At this time, in order to view this page, the file needs to be run locally.
